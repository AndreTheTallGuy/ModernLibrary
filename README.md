# Modern Library

This application is a library app that allows users to browse books, add books to a cart, and checkout their selected books. There is also a Wishlist which is like a cart where users can save books that they would like to check out at a later time. The user may also return their checked out books and begin the process anew.

## Set up

Simply clone the repo and open it up in your favorite IDE. If you are using intellij, you can run the application using Smart Tomcat:

File > Settings > Plug ins > Search Tomcat

Once Tomcat is installed, configure the application to run on Tomcat:

Run > Edit Configurations > plus sign in upper left corner > Smart Tomcat

- Name your configuration
- Link to Tomcat on your machine
- Change your context path to '/'
- Click OK

Your set up is now complete and you should be able to run the application!
